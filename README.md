# SG-NeonHorizon

This is a FFA made up of 8 teams of 2. 32 therium/luminite where each mine last 3x as long (first mine mines out at 30 minutes). Additionally 4 resource capture points are available from minute 4 and give between half a base of resources and 2 bases worth later in the game.

The mode is designed to keep econ scaling slower than usual forcing players into average sized comps with more tech and micro potential and forcing engagements to hold onto the resource capture points.
